# GroceryTime

[GroceryTime](https://groceryti.me) is an app to manage your grocery lists.

I wanted to create GroceryTime because I wasn't satisfied with any of the grocery list apps out there. I want to be able to see how often I buy certain things, at which store I bought certain things, and which recipes go with which items I bought. I also haven't found anything that perfectly matches the week-to-week grocery shopping habits that exist in my family. So in light of that, GroceryTime was born!
